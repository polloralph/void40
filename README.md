# VOID40
*A 40% handwired ortholinear keyboard*

The VOID40 is a 3d printable 40% ortholinear keyboard, designed to fit the bed of an Ender 3, handwired using a Pro Micro controller that is running the QMK Firmware.
The prints barely fit the bed of a stock Ender 3 if they are rotated 45 degrees, and with the skirt/brim disabled in your slicers settings.

*BOM*

* 4 M3x10(13mm overall length, 5.5mm diameter head) allen head screws for the bottom plate
* hot glue for securing the pro micro to the bottom case(optional, but recommended)
