# VOID40
*A 40% handwired ortholinear keyboard*

The VOID40 is a 3d printable 40% ortholinear keyboard, designed to fit the bed of an Ender 3, handwired using a Pro Micro controller that is running the QMK Firmware.
The prints fit the bed of a stock Ender 3 if they are rotated 45 degrees, with the skirt/brim disabled in your slicers settings.

*BOM for case assembly*
* 4 M3x10 countersunk screws for the top plate
* 4 M3x10(13mm overall length, 5.5mm diameter head) allen head screws for the bottom plate
* hot glue for securing the pro micro to the bottom case(optional, but recommended)

A fork containing the QMK config files can be found [here](https://github.com/victorlucachi/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/void40). Edit them to suit your own needs and build the firmware following the QMK docs.
